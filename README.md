# AI-Augmented Recon Toolkit

This project automates reconnaissance for ethical hacking and vulnerability management using PowerShell and Python. It includes automated host discovery, Nmap/Nuclei scanning, markdown reporting, and Power BI dashboard visualization — all structured around secure development standards (Microsoft SDL & CIS Benchmarks).
