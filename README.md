Output files are written to the **reports/** folder.


## üöÄ Getting Started (Example Use Case)

1. Clone this repo
2. Edit `target_list.txt` with IPs or hostnames
3. Run `host_discovery.ps1` or `recon_scan.py`
4. View output in `example_report.md` or `.pdf`
5. Open Power BI and import `.pbix` from `/PowerBI`
